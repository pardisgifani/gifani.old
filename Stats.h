                print_array() - Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen             [DONE]
                find_median() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value                   [DONE]
                find_mean() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean                             [DONE]
                find_maximum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum                       [DONE]
                find_minimum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum                       [DONE]
                sort_array() - Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest.   [DONE]
                        (The zeroth Element should be the largest value, and the last element (n-1) should be the smallest value. )
